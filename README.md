We are a small research group at WARSAW UNIVERSITY OF LIFE SCIENCES â€“ SGGW.

Our main research interest are biomedical images. We have an experience in many biomedical projects.

This repository contains code for melanoma classifiers. We are working on https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main
dataset which contains 23906 images from 2 classes (melanoma and bening skin mark)

Currently developed are tested on mnist dataset because we don't have enough resources to make experiments
on proper dataset.
